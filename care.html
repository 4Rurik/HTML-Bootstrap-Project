Most pets also require regular exercise to stay fit. It is important to find out all about an animal before deciding whether it will fit in well with you or your family.</p>

                        <p class="lead col-12 mx-5">A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're an experienced pet parent or a first-time adopter, it's important to keep your canine companion's health and happiness a top priority. Below are some useful tips for all dog parents. And remember: If you're considering bringing home a new dog, please make adoption your first option. We encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable dogs in our <a href="/adopt.html" style="text-decoration: none;"> Adopt a friend!</a> page.</p>

                        <p class="mx-5 col-12 mt-0 shrinkme">Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake. Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds). Please limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently.</p>

                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health. Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase.</p>                        
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are important. Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick control. Speak to your veterinarian about these and other options. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times a year. Before bathing, comb or cut out all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue.</p>                          
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog's chest, with either your forearm or other hand supporting the hind legs and rump. Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog by the forelegs, tail or back of the neck. If you do have to lift a large dog, lift from the underside, supporting his chest with one arm and his rear end with the other.</p>

                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Your pet needs a warm, quiet place to rest, away from all drafts and off the floor. A training crate or dog bed is ideal, with a clean blanket or pillow placed inside. Wash the dog's bedding often. If your dog will be spending a lot of time outdoors, be sure your dog has access to shade and plenty of cool water in hot weather, and a warm, dry, covered shelter when it's cold.</p>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Follow your community's licensing regulations. Be sure to attach the license to your dog's collar. This, along with an ID tag and implanted microchip or tattoo, can help secure your dog's return should your dog become lost.</p>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian or the Animal Poison Control Center for 24-hour animal poison information at (888) 426- 4435. Your dog may benefit from receiving a number of vaccinations. It is recommended that female dogs are spayed and male dogs neutered by six months of age.</p>

And remember: If you're considering bringing home a new cat, please make adoption your first option. We encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable cats in our <a href="/adopt.html" style="text-decoration: none;"> Adopt a friend!</a> page.</p>

                        <p class="mx-5 col-12 mt-0 shrinkme">We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food. Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet. Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat. Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine. You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat's water bowls daily. Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet. Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well. Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned. Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.</p>

                        <h3 class="col-4 mt-5 pb-0">Handling</h3>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Cats need to scratch! When a cat scratches, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the sharp, smooth claws underneath are exposed. Cutting your cat’s nails every two to three weeks will keep them relatively blunt and less likely to harm the arms of both humans and furniture. Provide your cat with a sturdy scratching post, at least three feet high. The post should also be stable enough that it won't wobble during use, and should be covered with rough material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many cats also like scratching pads. All indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet, accessible location. In a multi-level home, one box per floor is recommended. Avoid moving the box unless absolutely necessary, but if you must do so, move the box just a few inches per day. Keep in mind that cats won't use a messy, smelly litter box, so scoop solid wastes out of the box at least once a day. Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least once a week; you can do this less frequently if using clumping litter. Don't use ammonia, deodorants or scents, especially lemon, when cleaning the litter box. If your cat will not use a litterbox, please consult with your veterinarian. Sometimes refusal to use a litter box is based on a medical condition that required treatment.</p>                        
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean, reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.</p>                          
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">To pick up your cat, place one hand behind the front legs and another under the hindquarters. Lift gently. Never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or by the front legs.</p>

                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest. Line your cat's bed with a soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to wash the bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors. Outdoor cats do not live as long as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from cars, or from fights with other cats, raccoons and free-roaming dogs. Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor cats are more likely to become infested with fleas or ticks, as well as contract infectious diseases.</p>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">If allowed outdoors, your cat must wear a safety collar and an ID tag. A safety collar with an elastic panel will allow your cat to break loose if the collar gets caught on something. And for both indoor and outdoor cats, an ID tag or an implanted microchip can help ensure that your cat is returned if he or she becomes lost.</p>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Never give your cat medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian.

                        <p class="lead col-12 mx-5">Birds are extremely social by nature, and thrive on company, nurturing, and frequent interaction. Many species of birds make fun, engaging pets. If you're considering bird ownership, the care requirements include providing good housing, nutritious food, and keeping an eye on the bird's health. You'll also need to provide plenty of enrichment and interaction, to keep your pet bird happy and alert. With their own personalities and a lifespan of anywhere between 10-80 years, look after yours properly and you might just have a friend for life! And remember: If you're considering bringing home a new bird, please make adoption your first option. We encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable birds in our <a href="/adopt.html" style="text-decoration: none;"> Adopt a friend!</a> page.</p>
                        <hr class="my-4 col-12">
                        <p class="mx-5 col-12 mt-0 shrinkme">As a rule of thumb, a healthy diet for most bird breeds consists of 75% pellets and 25% human table foods. Since precise dietary requirements are dependent on the species, talk with an avian veterinarian to see what type of food your breed of bird needs. Over time, you'll begin to see patterns emerging in the types of food that your bird prefers. Usually, bird seed makes up the majority of your little pet's diet, and this is great for giving them a bunch of vitamins. However, be warned of dried, packaged seeds as these can be pretty low in the essentials your bird needs! Alongside seeds, your bird should be fed vegetables, especially the green variety. Spinach, parsley and celery are all good options. Birds can also have milk thistle, dandelion and fruit to keep them healthy and strong.</p>

                        <h3 class="col-4 mt-5 pb-0">Grooming</h3>
                        <h3 class="col-4 mt-5 pb-0">Handling</h3>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Most birds are very social creatures, so they'll bond to other birds or humans. You must not leave your bird on its own in a cage. Your bird needs attention and love, just like a cat or dog, so make sure you can give it just that. Having a bird as a pet is a big responsibility, but very rewarding too. Birds crave socialization with humans, and will become bored, lonely, and unhealthy if left in their cage all day. Birds can make great companions and, if you look after yours, you can really bond and flourish together! Just make sure you know exactly what your breed needs and give it all the love it deserves.</p>                        
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Provide water in a large enough container for self-cleansing. Birds are fully capable of handling their own grooming. Most likely, the bird will clean itself in its water bowl, provided the bowl is large enough for it to use as a bath. Also, birds bathe to keep cool in warmer weather, so be sure to provide water for washing in when the temperature is on the warmer side.</p>                          
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">As birds can get stressed quite easily, it is ideal for your bird to get used to you over several days. Don't try and grab your bird straight away, instead put your hand in the aviary or cage with some food, and eventually your bird will step on your finger. </p>

                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">In general, the larger the bird cage the better. Pet birds need room to exercise their wings and climb. A variety of bird toys that provide enrichment activities give these intelligent animals plenty of things to do. Finches and canaries enjoy flying throughout a cage, so a flight cage is always preferred, especially with multiple birds. A parrot requires toys for chewing, while a finch or canary enjoys a bell or swing. Part of learning how to look after a bird is getting them a safe, secure cage they can be happy in. This means getting one that's large enough for them to move comfortably in. We'd recommend that each bird has a space big enough for 2 birds to fully extend their wings. No matter how big or comfortable the cage is, letting your birds out of the cage as often as you can is essential. Whenever you're in the home and can supervise them, let them fly free. If you don't, your bird will most likely become overweight and depressed.</p>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Birds that live in aviaries should be wormed every three months, and inside birds need to be wormed at least twice a year.To prevent mites and lice, treat your bird every 6 weeks with a mite and lice spray. Spray your bird according to the instructions on the bottle, and on the cage and toys. Be sure to remove any food and water prior to treatment. Don't smoke cigarettes around your bird, not even in the same room! Pet birds can be harmed easily from cigarette smoke, so it's important you keep it away from them. Vet visits are required when your bird is looking ill. Keep a close eye on your bird for any of the following symptoms: not eating, puffed up feathers, sleeping excessively, throwing up, abnormal droppings, sitting low or at the bottom of the aviary/cage, and discharge from nostrils, eyes or beak.</p>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Never give your bird medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. Many medications that are safe for humans can be potentially deadly for birds even in small amounts. This includes painkillers, cold medicines, anti-cancer medications, antidepressants, vitamins and diet pills. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian or the Animal Poison Control Center for 24-hour animal poison information at (888) 426- 4435.</p>

                        <p class="lead col-12 mx-5">Rabbits are the third most popular furry pet after cats and dogs. But with unique care needs and behaviours, they're definitely not the same as cats or dogs. Rabbits are often incorrectly thought of as easy beginner pets (like a hamster). In reality, bunnies have much more complicated needs. The amount of care that a rabbit needs is closer to the amount of care a dog needs. many adopt new pet rabbits without first researching the proper way to take care of them, and because of that they end up with various health issues that could have been prevented. And remember: If you're considering bringing home a new bunny, please make adoption your first option.

                        <p class="mx-5 col-12 mt-0 shrinkme">Rabbits are herbivores, meaning they eat plants. They're built for a diet consisting of mainly large amounts of grass and leaves, as well as some flowers and fruits. Grass hay is the most important part of a rabbit's diet. Examples of grass hay include timothy hay, meadow, oat, rye, barley and Bermuda grasses. Rabbits should have grass hay available to them at all times. It's rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins and encourages healthy GI motility and the appropriate wearing down of teeth through chewing, and also decreases inappropriate chewing of other objects. Furthermore, grass hay helps create a full feeling in the rabbit's stomach to prevent overeating and obesity. It's proper for all ages. It's suggested to feed a variety of two or more different types of grass hay. It is also better to feed sun dried hay over commercially dried hay because it retains more of its nutrients. Another important part of a bunny's diet is Green foods, which include dandelion greens, collard greens, kale, romaine lettuce, broccoli, brussel sprouts, celery and parsley. Green foods have all the same nutritional benefits as hay, but contain a broader selection of nutrients and also provide water to the diet. This is very important because rabbits don't always drink as much as they should. If you feed the bunny a lot of greens, it is normal for them to drink less water. Green foods are great for the kidneys, bladder, and gastrointestinal tract. The diet shouldn't consist of primarily green foods since they don't have enough calories to sustain a rabbit's normal body weight. Green foods are appropriate for all ages of rabbit. If it's possible, you should buy organic or grow your own green foods, and make sure to wash all greens first. It is recommended to feed at least 3 varieties of greens daily. You should also include Fruits and Vegetables in your rabbit's daily diet as treats. They can be used as a reward during training as well. Fruits and veggies are much healthier and cost less than commercial rabbit treats, which should be avoided because most are high in starch and fat and can cause serious health concerns. Examples of natural treats you can give to your bunny include apples, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, cherries, cranberries, carrots, green or red bell peppers, mango, peach, pineapple and squash. You can also feed dried fruits, but should reduce to one third of the normal amount because they are so concentrated. Bananas and grapes are not recommended because rabbits can get hooked on these foods and may not want to eat anything else.</p>

                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Rabbits need lots of exercise and enrichment to stave off boredom and to promote positive physical and mental health. At least four hours each day outside of a cage. You can let your rabbit hop around your house or inside a large fenced-in area safe from other animals. Be sure to “rabbit-proof” your home by covering electrical cords and moving household plants out of reach. When the weather is nice, you can also take your rabbit outside for some supervised playtime inside a pen. Use your imagination when enriching your rabbit's environment but ensure that everything you use is safe, non-toxic, and will not cause injury</p>                        
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">While rabbits groom themselves, much like cats do, you do need to know how to take care of a rabbit's grooming needs. To keep your rabbit's coat nice and healthy, regularly groom them with a soft brush. This is particularly important for long-haired rabbits. Rabbits also moult a few times a year and will require additional brushing at this time. Rabbits with short coats should be groomed weekly and even more regularly when they are moulting. This will also strengthen your bond with your pet. Long-haired rabbits will need daily grooming as their coats can quickly become matted and uncomfortable. Indoor rabbit have no way to get their nails filed down. This means that regular nail clipping is in order. This will not only keep the nails from growing and curling back into the paw; it will save on damage to furniture, clothes, etc.</p>                          
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Rabbits are sociable animals who will enjoy lots of attention and company from you. However, it might take them a little while to get used to you and your home. A rabbit's backbone is fragile and can fracture very easily if the rabbit gives a strong kick, so it is always important to support the hind end. Never pick a bunny up by the ears because it's painful for them and simply not necessary. It's better to grasp the loose skin over the shoulders and scoop the rabbit up under the chest. Then, place the other hand under the back legs to lift from the floor. When you're first learning how to handle a rabbit, it's better to practice close to the floor so that if the rabbit jumps out of your arms, it won't be a big fall.</p>

                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">A rabbit's cage should allow them to stand on their hind legs without hitting their heads on the top of the cage, have space for a litter box and a resting area, be easy to clean, and be made of metal or another indestructible material. Cages should be kept in a cool and well-ventilated area. It's not recommended to place your rabbit's cage in the basement because it is usually too damp and could cause respiratory disease. If the area is too hot, the rabbit can potentially suffer from fatal heat stroke. Rabbits can be caged outdoors, although it is not ideal. If they are going to be outside, they will require shelter from precipitation and extreme temperatures. They should be safe from predators like dogs, coyotes and raccoons. The cage should be kept clean to not attract parasitic insects. In the winter, straw bedding can be used as insulation. The water bowl should be changed daily, especially in the winter when it can freeze. Pet rabbits should never be kept in a cage at all times. Rabbits also need a Resting/Hiding Area in their environment. A box full of hay is enough for some rabbits, while others prefer an enclosed box to hide in. You can use an untreated wicker or straw basket, litter pan, or a cardboard box with an entrance hole and bottom removed. If the cage has a wire floor, they should also be provided with a solid area they can rest, with washable or disposable material. Don't use carpet squares because they are not absorbent, are abrasive to their little feet, and they can't be cleaned. They can also be easily eaten and are the #1 cause of obstruction in rabbits.</p>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">One huge factor in how to care for a rabbit is in the area of waste. Indoor rabbits can be litter-box trained, much like a cat. Overall, taking the time to train them will probably make your life easier. Should you not choose to litter-box train your rabbit, you will need to provide areas for their daily needs. If you are using a dog crate or rabbit condo, use newspaper, shredded paper, newspaper pellets, or other degradable substance on the floor of the enclosure. This will need to be changed regularly.</p>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Never give your bunny medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian or the Animal Poison Control Center for 24-hour animal poison information at (888) 426- 4435. There are no particularly recommended vaccines for rabbits, but pet rabbits should be seen by a veterinarian at least once a year for a checkup and it is recommended that all pet rabbits should be spayed or neutered when they reach maturity. This helps prevent uterine cancer in female rabbits, aggressive behaviors like mounting and spraying in male rabbits and unintended breeding.</p>

                        <p class="lead col-12 mx-5">Tortoises are long-lived, hearty, and reasonably easy to care for. They are not an ideal pet to keep indoors, and not a pet that is played with, cuddled, or handled very often. Tortoises thrive best where they get sunshine and fresh air. Some tortoises are shy and reclusive, while others are charismatic, inquisitive, and have personality. All tortoises are quiet, attractive and exhibit interesting behavior. Tortoises and other reptiles carry salmonella bacteria, which can be easily transmitted to people. A small turtle may seem harmless, giving parents a false sense that they're a safe pet for children. And remember: If you're considering bringing home a new tortoise, please make adoption your first option. We encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable tortoises in our <a href="/adopt.html" style="text-decoration: none;"> Adopt a friend!</a> page.</p>
                        <hr class="my-4 col-12">
                        <p class="mx-5 col-12 mt-0 shrinkme">Almost all tortoises are true herbivores, so their diet should reflect this. Tortoises need a diet that is low in protein but high in fiber and calcium, primarily consisting of daily plant matter (spring mix, dark, leafy greens, and grasses/hay) and pellets. On a daily basis, your tortoise's diet should be approximately 80% vegetables, mainly greens. They are partial to things like mustard greens, collard greens, and dandelion greens. They can also have foods like sweet potatoes, bell peppers, and cauliflower. The diet should include fresh fruits like strawberries, blueberries, cherries, and melon. Fruits shouldn't be offered daily, though. A healthy tortoise diet includes a variety of vegetables and some fruits for treats (no more than 5% of their diet).</p>

                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">It's unlikely your tortoise will appreciate being carried around, so this should only be done when necessary. Offering scratches and pets, especially during feeding time, will help build trust. Tortoises, like most reptiles, carry Salmonella bacteria in their intestinal tract, which comes out in their feces. For your own safety, wash your hands and the cage regularly. Keep this in mind and take precautions, especially with young children or around anyone with a compromised immune system.</p>
                        <p class="col-4 mx-0 px-5 mt-0 shrinkme">Tortoises are generally kept in glass tanks or aquariums, which makes observation easy. There should be two sections within the tortoise's enclosure: a water section and a landing area or dock. Water should be provided to a depth of at least 15cm and increased as the turtle grows. The temperature of the water should not exceed 28 degrees celsius, but cannot be too cold either. The ideal temperature is 22 degrees celsius. An incandescent lamp suspended over the tank or an aquatic heater with a thermostat will help achieve this. A good quality filter is recommended as well as providing calcium blocks to reduce the acidity of the water and help maintain a strong, healthy shell. Sunlight is necessary for proper bone formation and shell hardening of your tortoise. Special fluorescent lights can be used preferably with a UVB rating of at least 5. The tank should be cleaned regularly to prevent algae and dropping build ups. Water changes of 25% should occur weekly as well as pH tests done with the levels between pH >7 to 8.4.</p>
